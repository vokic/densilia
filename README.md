I approached this task with finding a reusable solution to implement in various websites regardless of their framework.

The solution I was exploring is **Angular Elements** (self contained standalone component that can be used outside Angular app, without the requirement of the app to be in made with Angular or to require complete Angular framework.

I’ve created a set of styles for every element, whos properties come from API backend that is set up for each client (practice), for example:

*	Button color
*	Button hover color
*	Button icon and label color
*	Menu background color

Every property will receive it’s value in a form of .json response that would be matched to the property.
Then the file would be bundeled and reused in the client side.

The frame should be the same everywhere, and the client would have various options to choose from to decorate the menu. Options would be set up in advance. We could also offer consultation for a design to match their brand colors.

The idea is that the menu cannot be different in size, shape etc. It should be consistent across all websites, only colors should be customizable, initially on setup. Client cannot style it on his part.

Also I would consider implementing Densilia logo somewhere.

Here is the preview, also I have uploaded the video:
